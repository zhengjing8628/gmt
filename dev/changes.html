<h2>New Features in GMT 5.4<a class="headerlink" href="#new-features-in-gmt-5-4" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Between 5.3 and 5.4 we continued to work on the underlying API
needed to support the modules and especially the external interfaces
we are building toward MATLAB, Julia and Python.  We have introduced the use of
static analyzers to fix any code irregularities and we continue to submit
our builds to Coverity for similar reasons.  We have also made an effort
to standardize GMT non-common option usage across the suite.
Nevertheless, there have been many user-level enhancements as well.
Here is a summary of these changes in three key areas:</p>
<div class="section" id="new-modules">
<h3>New modules<a class="headerlink" href="#new-modules" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>We have added a new module to the GMT core called
<a class="reference internal" href="ternary.html"><span class="doc">ternary</span></a>.
This module allows for the construction of ternary diagram, currently
restricted to symbols (i.e., a plot-like experience but for ternary data).
The <em>mgd77</em> supplement has gained a new tool <a class="reference internal" href="supplements/mgd77/mgd77header.html"><span class="doc">mgd77header</span></a>
for creating a valid MGD77-format header from basic metadata and information
determined from the header-less data file.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="general-improvements">
<h3>General improvements<a class="headerlink" href="#general-improvements" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A range of new capabilities have been added to all of GMT; here is a
summary of these changes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>We have added a new lower-case GMT common option.  Programs that read
ASCII data can use <strong>-e</strong> to only select data records that match a
specified pattern or regular expression.</li>
<li>All modules can now read data via external URL addresses.  This works
by using libcurl to access an external file and save it to the users’
GMT cache directory.  This directory can be specified via a new GMT
defaults called <a class="reference internal" href="gmt.conf.html#dir-cache"><span class="std std-ref">DIR_CACHE</span></a> (and defaults to
the sub-directory cache under the <strong>$GMT_USERDIR</strong> directory [~/.gmt]).
Subsequent use of the same URL will be read from the cache (except
if explicitly removed by the user).  An exception is CGI Get Commands
which will be executed anew each time. Both the user directory and
the cache directory will be created if they do not exist.</li>
<li>Any reference to Earth topographic/bathymetric relief files called
<strong>&#64;earth_relief_</strong><em>res</em><strong>.grd</strong> will automatically obtain the grid
from the GMT data server.  The resolution <em>res</em> allows a choice among
13 command grid spacings: 60m, 30m, 20m, 15m, 10m, 06m, 05m, 04m, 03m, 02m,
01m, 30s, and 15s (with file sizes 111 kb, 376 kb, 782 kb, 1.3 Mb, 2.8 Mb,
7.5 Mb, 11 Mb, 16 Mb, 27 Mb, 58 Mb, 214 Mb, 778 Mb, and 2.6 Gb respectively).
Once one of these have been downloaded any future reference will simply
obtain the file from <strong>$GMT_USERDIR</strong> (except if explicitly
removed by the user).</li>
<li>We are laying the groundwork for more dynamic documentation.  At present,
the examples on the man pages (with the exception of <em>basemap</em> and <em>coast</em>)
cannot be run by cut and paste since they reference imaginary data sets.
These will soon appear with filenames starting in &#64; (e.g., &#64;hotspots.txt),
and when such files are found on the command line it is interpreted to be
a shorthand notation for the full URL to the GMT cache data server.</li>
<li>We have added four new color tables inspired by matplotlib to the collection.
These CPTs are called plasma, magma, inferno, and viridis.</li>
<li>We have updated the online documentation of user-contributed custom symbols and
restored the beautiful biological symbols for whales and dolphins created by
Pablo Valdés during the GMT4 era. These are now complemented by new custom
symbols for structural geology designed by José A. Álvarez-Gómez.</li>
<li>The <a class="reference internal" href="postscriptlight.html"><span class="doc">PSL</span></a> library no longer needs run-time files to configure the
list of standard fonts and character encodings, reducing the number of configure
files required.</li>
<li>The <a class="reference internal" href="gmt.conf.html"><span class="doc">gmt.conf</span></a> files produced by gmt set will only write parameters that differ
from the GMT SI Standard settings.  This means most gmt.conf files will just
be a few lines.</li>
<li>We have deprecated the <strong>-c</strong><em>copies</em> option whose purpose was to modify the
number of copies a printer would issue give a PostScript file.  This is better
controlled by your printer driver and most users now work with PDF files.</li>
<li>The <strong>-p</strong> option can now do a simple rotation about the z-axis (i.e., not a
perspective view) for more advanced plotting.</li>
<li>The placement of color scales around a map can now be near-automatic, as
the <strong>-DJ</strong> setting now has many default values (such as for bar length,
width, offsets and orientation) based on which side you specified.  If you
use this option in concert with <strong>-B</strong> to turn off frame annotation on the
side you place the scale bar then justification works exactly.</li>
<li>The <strong>-i</strong> option to select input columns can now handle repeat entries,
e.g., -i0,2,2,4, which is useful when a column is needed as a coordinate
<em>and</em> for symbol color or size.</li>
<li>The vector specifications now take one more modifier: <strong>+h</strong><em>shape</em>
allows vectors to quickly set the head shape normally specified via
<a class="reference internal" href="gmt.conf.html#map-vector-shape"><span class="std std-ref">MAP_VECTOR_SHAPE</span></a>.  This is particularly useful
when the symbol types are given via the input file.</li>
<li>The custom symbol macro language has been strengthened and now allows all
angular quantities to be variables (i.e., provided from your data file as
extra columns), the pen thickness can be specified as relative (and thus
scale with the symbol size at run-time), and a symbol can internally switch
colors between the pen and fill colors given on the command line.</li>
<li>We have reintroduced the old GMT4 polygon-vector for those who fell so hard
in love with that symbol.  By giving old-style vector specifications you
will now get the old-style symbol.  The new and superior vector symbols
will require the use of the new (and standard) syntax.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="module-enhancements">
<h3>Module enhancements<a class="headerlink" href="#module-enhancements" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Several modules have obtained new options to extend their capabilities:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference internal" href="gmt.html"><span class="doc">gmt</span></a> has new session management option that lets you clear various
files and cache directories via the new commands
<strong>gmt clear</strong> <em>all</em>|<em>history</em>|<em>conf</em>|<em>cache</em>.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="gmt2kml.html"><span class="doc">gmt2kml</span></a> adds option <strong>-Fw</strong> for drawing wiggles along track.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="gmtinfo.html"><span class="doc">info</span></a> adds option <strong>-F</strong> for reporting the number of tables,
segments, records, headers, etc.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="gmtmath.html"><span class="doc">math</span></a> will convert all plot dimensions given on the command line
to the prevailing length unit set via <a class="reference internal" href="gmt.conf.html#proj-length-unit"><span class="std std-ref">PROJ_LENGTH_UNIT</span></a>.
This allows you to combine measurements like 12c, 4i, and 72p. The module
also has a new <strong>SORT</strong> operator for sorting columns and <strong>RMSW</strong> for weighted
root-mean-square.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="gmtwhich.html"><span class="doc">which</span></a> <strong>-G</strong> will download a file from the internet (as discussed
above) before reporting the path to the file (which will then be in the
user’s cache directory).</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="grd2xyz.html"><span class="doc">grd2xyz</span></a> can now write weights equal to the area each node represents
via the <strong>-Wa</strong> option.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="grdgradient.html"><span class="doc">grdgradient</span></a> can now take a grid of azimuths via the <strong>-A</strong> option.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="grdimage.html"><span class="doc">grdimage</span></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="grdview.html"><span class="doc">grdview</span></a> can now auto-compute the intensities
directly from the required input grid via <strong>-I</strong>, and this option now
supports modifiers <strong>+a</strong> and <strong>+n</strong> for changing the options of the
grdgradient call within the module.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="grdinfo.html"><span class="doc">grdinfo</span></a> adds option <strong>-D</strong> to determine the regions of all the
smaller-size grid tiles required to cover the larger area.  It also take
a new argument <strong>-Ii</strong> for reporting the exact region of an img grid.
Finally, we now report area-weighted statistics for geographic grids,
added <strong>-Lp</strong> for mode (maximum-likelihood) estimate of location and scale,
and <strong>-La</strong> for requesting all of the statistical estimates.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="grdmath.html"><span class="doc">grdmath</span></a> has new operators <strong>TRIM</strong>, which will set all grid values
that fall in the specified tails of the data distribution to NaN, <strong>NODE</strong>,
which will create a grid with node indices 0 to (nx*ny)-1, and <strong>RMSW</strong>,
which will compute the weighted root-mean-square.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="makecpt.html"><span class="doc">makecpt</span></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="grd2cpt.html"><span class="doc">grd2cpt</span></a> add option <strong>-Ws</strong> for producing
wrapped (cyclic) CPT tables that repeat endlessly.  New CPT keyword
<strong>CYCLIC</strong> controls if the CPT is cyclic.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="mapproject.html"><span class="doc">mapproject</span></a> adds a new <strong>-Z</strong> option for temporal calculations based
on distances and speeds, and has been redesigned to allow several outputs
by combining the options <strong>-A</strong>, <strong>-G</strong>, <strong>-L</strong>, and <strong>-Z</strong>.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="basemap.html"><span class="doc">basemap</span></a> has a new map-inset (<strong>-D</strong>) modifier <strong>+t</strong> that will
translate the plot origin after determining the lower-left corner of the
map inset.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="histogram.html"><span class="doc">histogram</span></a> has a new <strong>-Z</strong> modifier <strong>+w</strong> that will
accumulate weights provided in the 2nd input column instead of pure counts.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="rose.html"><span class="doc">rose</span></a> adds option <strong>-Q</strong> for setting the  confidence level used
for a Rayleigh test for uniformity of direction.  The <strong>-C</strong> option also
takes a new modifier <strong>+w</strong><em>modfile</em> for storing mode direction to file.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="gmt_shell_functions.sh.html"><span class="doc">gmt_shell_functions.sh</span></a> adds numerous new functions to simplify the
building of animation scripts, animated GIF and MP4 videos, launching
groups of jobs across many cores, packaging KMLs into a single KMZ archive,
and more.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="api-changes">
<h3>API changes<a class="headerlink" href="#api-changes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>We have introduced one change that breaks backwards compatibility for users of
the API functions.  We don’t do this lightly but given the API is still considered
beta it was the best solution.  Function GMT_Create_Data now requires the mode to
be <strong>GMT_IS_OUTPUT</strong> (an new constant) if a dummy (empty) container should be
created to hold the output of a module.  We also added two new API functions
GMT_Duplicate_Options and GMT_Free_Option to manage option lists, and added
the new constants <strong>GMT_GRID_IS_CARTESIAN</strong> and <strong>GMT_GRID_IS_GEO</strong> so that
external tools can communicate the nature of grid written in situations where there
are no projections involved (hence GMT does not know a grid is geographic).
Passing this constant will be required in MB-System.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="backwards-compatible-syntax-changes">
<h3>Backwards-compatible syntax changes<a class="headerlink" href="#backwards-compatible-syntax-changes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>We strive to keep the GMT user interface consistent.  The common options help
with that, but the module-specific options have often used very different
forms to achieve similar goals.  We have revised the syntax of numerous options
across the modules to use the common <em>modifier</em> method.  However, as no GMT
users would be happy that their
scripts no longer run, these changes are backwards compatible.  Only the new
syntax will be documented but old syntax will be accepted.  Some options are
used across GMT and will get a special mention first:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Many modules use <strong>-G</strong> to specify the fill (solid color or pattern).
The pattern specification has now changed to be
<strong>-Gp</strong>|<strong>P</strong><em>pattern</em>[<strong>+b</strong><em>color</em>][<strong>+f</strong><em>color</em>][<strong>+r</strong><em>dpi</em>]</li>
<li>When specifying grids one can always add information such as grid type, scaling,
offset, etc.  This is now done using a cleaner syntax for grids:
gridfile[=<em>ID</em>[<strong>+s</strong><em>scale</em>][<strong>+o</strong><em>offset</em>][<strong>+n</strong><em>invalid</em>]].</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a list of modules with revised options:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference internal" href="grdcontour.html"><span class="doc">grdcontour</span></a> now expects <strong>-Z</strong>[<strong>+</strong><em>scale</em>][<strong>+o</strong><em>offset</em>][<strong>+p</strong>].</li>
<li>In <a class="reference internal" href="grdedit.html"><span class="doc">grdedit</span></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="xyz2grd.html"><span class="doc">xyz2grd</span></a>, the mechanism to change a grid’s
metadata is now done via modifiers to the <strong>-D</strong> option, such as
<strong>+x</strong><em>xname</em>, <strong>+t</strong><em>title</em>, etc.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="grdfft.html"><span class="doc">grdfft</span></a> has changed to <strong>-E</strong>[<strong>+w</strong>[<strong>k</strong>]][<strong>+n</strong>].</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="grdgradient.html"><span class="doc">grdgradient</span></a> modifies the syntax of <strong>-E</strong> and <strong>-N</strong> by introducing modifiers,
i.e., <strong>-E</strong>[<strong>m</strong>|<strong>s</strong>|<strong>p</strong>]<em>azim/elev</em>[<strong>+a</strong><em>ambient</em>][<strong>+d</strong><em>diffuse</em>][<strong>+p</strong><em>specular</em>][<strong>+s</strong><em>shine</em>] and
<strong>-N</strong>[<strong>e</strong>|<strong>t</strong>][<em>amp</em>][<strong>+s</strong><em>sigma</em>][<strong>+o</strong><em>offset</em>].</li>

<h2>New Features in GMT 5.3<a class="headerlink" href="#new-features-in-gmt-5-3" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Between 5.2 and 5.3 we spent much time working on the underlying API
needed to support the modules and especially the external interfaces
we are building toward MATLAB and Python.  Nevertheless, there have
been many user-level enhancements as well.
Here is a summary of these changes in three key areas:</p>
<div class="section" id="id1">
<h3>New modules<a class="headerlink" href="#id1" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>We have added a new module to the GMT core called
<a class="reference internal" href="solar.html"><span class="doc">solar</span></a>.
This module plots various day-light terminators and other sunlight parameters.</p>
<p>Two new modules have been added to the <em>spotter</em> supplement:
The first is <a class="reference internal" href="supplements/spotter/gmtpmodeler.html"><span class="doc">gmtpmodeler</span></a>.
Like <a class="reference internal" href="supplements/spotter/grdpmodeler.html"><span class="doc">grdpmodeler</span></a> it evaluates plate
tectonic model predictions but at given point locations locations instead of
on a grid.  The second is <a class="reference internal" href="supplements/spotter/rotsmoother.html"><span class="doc">rotsmoother</span></a>
which smooths estimated rotations using quaternions.</p>
<p>Also, the <em>meca</em> supplement has gained a new tool <a class="reference internal" href="supplements/meca/sac.html"><span class="doc">sac</span></a>
for the plotting of seismograms in SAC format.</p>
<p>Finally, we have added <a class="reference internal" href="supplements/potential/gpsgridder.html"><span class="doc">gpsgridder</span></a>
to the <em>potential</em> supplement.  This tool is a Green’s function gridding module
that grids vector data assumed to be coupled via an elastic model.  The prime
usage is for gridding GPS velocity components.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id2">
<h3>General improvements<a class="headerlink" href="#id2" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>There are many changes to GMT, mostly under the hood, but also changes that
affect users directly.  We have added four new examples and one new animation
to highlight recently added capabilities.  There have been many bug fixes
as well. For specific enhancements, we have:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>All GMT-distributed color palette tables (CPTs, now a total of 44) are
<em>dynamic</em> and many have a <em>hinge</em> and a default <em>range</em>.  What this means
is that the range of all CPTs have been normalized to 0-1, expect that
those with a hinge are normalized to -1/+1, with 0 being the normalized
hinge location.  CPTs with a hinge are interpolated separately on either
side of the hinge, since a hinge typically signifies a dramatic color
change (e.g., at sea-level) and we do not want that color change to be
shifted to some other <em>z</em>-value when an asymmetrical range is being
requested.  In situations where no range is specified then some CPTs
will have a default range and that will be substituted instead.  The
tools <a class="reference internal" href="makecpt.html"><span class="doc">makecpt</span></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="grd2cpt.html"><span class="doc">grd2cpt</span></a> now displays more meta-data
about the various CPTs, including values for hinge, range, and the
color-model used.</li>
<li>We have consolidated how map embellishments are specified.  This group
includes map scales, color bars, legends, map roses, map insets,
image overlays, the GMT logo, and a background panel.  A new section in the Cookbook is
dedicated to these items and how they are specified.  Common to all is
the concept of a <em>reference point</em> relative to which the item is
<em>justified</em> and <em>offset</em>.</li>
<li>We continue to extend support for OpenMP in GMT.  New modules that are
OpenMP-enabled are <a class="reference internal" href="grdgradient.html"><span class="doc">grdgradient</span></a>, <a class="reference internal" href="grdlandmask.html"><span class="doc">grdlandmask</span></a>, and <a class="reference internal" href="sph2grd.html"><span class="doc">sph2grd</span></a>.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="blockmean.html"><span class="doc">blockmean</span></a>, <a class="reference internal" href="blockmedian.html"><span class="doc">blockmedian</span></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="blockmode.html"><span class="doc">blockmode</span></a> have a new
modifier <strong>+s</strong> to the <strong>-W</strong> option.  When used we expect 1-sigma
uncertainties instead of weights and compute weight = 1/sigma.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="filter1d.html"><span class="doc">filter1d</span></a>: can now compute high-pass filtered output via a new
<strong>+h</strong> modifier to the filter settings, similar to existing capability
in <a class="reference internal" href="grdfilter.html"><span class="doc">grdfilter</span></a>.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="gmtconvert.html"><span class="doc">convert</span></a> has a new option (<strong>-F</strong>) for line segmentation and
network configuration. Also, the <strong>-D</strong> option has a new modifier <strong>+o</strong>
that sets the origin used for the numbering of tables and segments.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="gmtinfo.html"><span class="doc">info</span></a> has a new option <strong>-L</strong> for finding the common bounds
across multiple files or segments.  Also, the <strong>-T</strong> option has been
modified (while still being backwards compatible) to allow <em>dz</em> to be
optional, with modifiers <strong>+s</strong> forcing a symmetric range and <strong>+a</strong>
offering <em>alpha</em>-trimming of the tails before estimating the range.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="gmtmath.html"><span class="doc">math</span></a> has gained new operators <strong>VAR</strong>,
<strong>RMS</strong>, <strong>DENAN</strong>, as well as the weighted statistical operators
<strong>LMSSCLW</strong>, <strong>MADW</strong>, <strong>MEANW</strong>, <strong>MEDIANW</strong>, <strong>MODEW</strong>, <strong>PQUANTW</strong>,
<strong>STDW</strong>, and <strong>VARW</strong>.  Finally, we added a <strong>SORT</strong> operator that lets
you sort an entire table in ascending or descending order based on the
values in a selected column.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="gmtselect.html"><span class="doc">select</span></a> has a new option <strong>-G</strong> for selecting based on a mask grid.
Points falling in bins whose grid nodes are non-zero are selected (or not if <strong>-Ig</strong>)</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="gmtspatial.html"><span class="doc">spatial</span></a> has two new modifiers for the <strong>-Q</strong> option that allow
output segments to be limited based on the segment length (or area for
polygons) as well as sorting the output in ascending or descending order.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="grd2cpt.html"><span class="doc">grd2cpt</span></a> existing <strong>-F</strong> option now takes a new modifier <strong>+c</strong>
for writing a discrete palette using the categorical format.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="grdedit.html"><span class="doc">grdedit</span></a> can now reset text items in the header via <strong>-D</strong> by
specifying ‘-‘.  Also, new <strong>-C</strong> option can be used to reset the
command history in the header.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="grdfft.html"><span class="doc">grdfft</span></a> has a new modifier to the <strong>-E</strong> option that allows for more
control of the power normalization for radial spectra.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="grdmath.html"><span class="doc">grdmath</span></a> also has the new operators <strong>VAR</strong>,
<strong>RMS</strong>, <strong>DENAN</strong>, as well as the weighted statistical operators
<strong>LMSSCLW</strong>, <strong>MADW</strong>, <strong>MEANW</strong>, <strong>MEDIANW</strong>, <strong>MODEW</strong>, <strong>PQUANTW</strong>,
<strong>STDW</strong>, and <strong>VARW</strong>.  In addition it gains a new
<strong>AREA</strong> operator which computes the gridcell area (in km<sup>2</sup> if the
grid is geographic).  Finally, operators <strong>MEAN</strong>, <strong>MEDIAN</strong>, etc.,
when working on a geographic grid, will weight the result using the
<strong>AREA</strong> function for proper spherical statistics.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="grdvolume.html"><span class="doc">grdvolume</span></a> can now accept <strong>-Cr</strong><em>cval</em> which will evaluate

The <strong>-F</strong> option now takes a new modifier <strong>+c</strong> for writing a discrete
palette using the categorical format.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="text.html"><span class="doc">text</span></a> has new modifiers to its <strong>-F</strong> option that allows users
to generate automatic labels such as record numbers of formatting of a
third data column into a textual representation.  We also allow any
baseline angles to be interpreted as <em>orientations</em>, i.e., they will be
modified to fall in the -90/+90 range when <strong>-F</strong>…<strong>+A</strong> is set.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="rose.html"><span class="doc">rose</span></a> can now control the attributes of vectors in a windrose
diagram via <strong>-M</strong>.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="plot.html"><span class="doc">plot</span></a> have seen numerous enhancements.  New features include
<em>decorated</em> lines, which are similar to quoted lines except we place
symbols rather than text along the line.  Users also gain new controls
over the plotting of lines, including the ability to add vector heads
to the line endings, to trim back lines by specified amounts, and to
request a Bezier spline interpolation in PostScript (see enhanced
<strong>-W</strong> option).  A new option (<strong>-F</strong>) for line segmentation and networks
have also been added. Various geographic symbols (such as ellipses; <strong>-SE</strong>,
rotatable rectangles <strong>-SJ</strong>; and geo-vectors <strong>-S=</strong>) can now take size in geographic
dimensions, including a new geo-wedge symbol.  We also offer one more
type of fault-slip symbol, using curved arrow heads.  Also the arrow
head selections now include inward-pointing arrows.  Custom symbols
may now simply be a preexisting EPS figure.  Many of these enhancements
are also available in <a class="reference internal" href="plot3d.html"><span class="doc">plot3d</span></a>.</li>
<li>The spotter supplement now comes with the latest rotation files from
EarthByte, U. of Sydney.</li>

<h3>The API<a class="headerlink" href="#the-api" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>We have spend most of our time strengthening the API, in particular in support
of the GMT/MATLAB toolbox.  A few new API functions have been added since the
initial release, including GMT_Get_Pixel, GMT_Set_Index, GMT_Open_VirtualFile,
GMT_Close_VirtualFile, GMT_Read_VirtualFile, GMT_Read_Group, and GMT_Convert_Data;
see the API <a class="reference internal" href="GMT_API.html"><span class="doc">Introduction</span></a> for details.</p>

<h2>New Features in GMT 5.2<a class="headerlink" href="#new-features-in-gmt-5-2" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>While the GMT 5.1-series has seen bug-fixes since its release, new features were
only added to the 5.2-series.  All in all, almost 200 new features (a combination
of new programs, new options, and enhancements) have been implemented.
Here is a summary of these changes in six key areas:</p>
<div class="section" id="id3">
<h3>New modules<a class="headerlink" href="#id3" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>There are two new modules in the core system:</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="gmtlogo.html"><span class="doc">gmtlogo</span></a> is modeled after the shell script with the same
name but is now a regular C module that can be used to add the
GMT logo to maps and posters.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="gmtregress.html"><span class="doc">regress</span></a> determines linear regressions for data sets using
a variety of misfit norms and regression modes.</p>
<p>Four new modules have also been added to the <em>potential</em> supplement:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt><a class="reference internal" href="supplements/potential/gmtflexure.html"><span class="doc">gmtflexure</span></a>:</dt>
<dd>Compute the elastic flexural response to a 2-D (line) load.</dd>
<dt><a class="reference internal" href="supplements/potential/grdflexure.html"><span class="doc">grdflexure</span></a>:</dt>
<dd>Compute the flexural response to a 3-D (grid) load, using a variety
or rheological models (elastic, viscoelastic, firmoviscous).</dd>
<dt><a class="reference internal" href="supplements/potential/talwani2d.html"><span class="doc">talwani2d</span></a>:</dt>
<dd>Compute a profile of the free-air gravity, geoid or vertical gravity gradient anomaly
over a 2-D body given as cross-sectional polygons.</dd>
<dt><a class="reference internal" href="supplements/potential/talwani3d.html"><span class="doc">talwani3d</span></a>:</dt>
<dd>Compute a grid or profile of the free-air gravity, geoid or vertical gravity gradient anomaly
over a 3-D body given as horizontal polygonal slices.</dd>
</dl>
<p>In addition, two established modules have been given more suitable names
(however, the old names are still recognized):</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt><a class="reference internal" href="grdconvert.html"><span class="doc">grdconvert</span></a></dt>
<dd>Converts between different grid formats.
Previously known as grdreformat (this name is recognized
when GMT is running in compatibility mode).</dd>
<dt><a class="reference internal" href="psconvert.html"><span class="doc">psconvert</span></a></dt>
<dd>Converts from PostScript to PDF, SVG, or various raster image formats.
Previously known as ps2raster (this name is recognized
when GMT is running in compatibility mode).</dd>
</dl>
<p>Finally, we have renamed our PostScript Light (PSL) library from psl
to PostScriptLight to avoid package name conflicts.  This library will eventually
become decoupled from GMT and end up as a required prerequisite.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="new-common-options">
<h3>New common options<a class="headerlink" href="#new-common-options" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>We have added two new lower-case GMT common options:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Programs that need to specify which values should represent “no data”
can now use <strong>-d</strong>[<strong>i</strong>|<strong>o</strong>]<em>nodata</em>. For instance, this
option replaces the old <strong>-N</strong> in <a class="reference internal" href="grd2xyz.html"><span class="doc">grd2xyz</span></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="xyz2grd.html"><span class="doc">xyz2grd</span></a>
(but is backwards compatible).</li>
<li>Some modules are now using OpenMP to spread computations over all
available cores (only available if compiled with OpenMP support).
Those modules will offer the new option <strong>-x</strong>[[-]<em>n</em>] to reduce
how many cores to assign to the task.  The modules that currently
have this option are <a class="reference internal" href="greenspline.html"><span class="doc">greenspline</span></a>, <a class="reference internal" href="grdmask.html"><span class="doc">grdmask</span></a>, <a class="reference internal" href="grdmath.html"><span class="doc">grdmath</span></a>,
<a class="reference internal" href="grdfilter.html"><span class="doc">grdfilter</span></a>, <a class="reference internal" href="grdsample.html"><span class="doc">grdsample</span></a>, <a class="reference internal" href="sph2grd.html"><span class="doc">sph2grd</span></a>, the potential supplement’s
<a class="reference internal" href="supplements/potential/grdgravmag3d.html"><span class="doc">grdgravmag3d</span></a>,
<a class="reference internal" href="supplements/potential/talwani2d.html"><span class="doc">talwani2d</span></a> and
<a class="reference internal" href="supplements/potential/talwani3d.html"><span class="doc">talwani3d</span></a>, and the x2sys
supplement’s <a class="reference internal" href="supplements/x2sys/x2sys_solve.html"><span class="doc">x2sys_solve</span></a>.
This list will grow longer with time.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="new-default-parameters">
<h3>New default parameters<a class="headerlink" href="#new-default-parameters" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>There have been a few changes to the GMT Defaults parameters.  All changes
are backwards compatible:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>FORMAT_FLOAT_MAP</strong> now allows the use %’g to get comma-separated groupings
when integer values are plotted.</li>
<li><strong>FORMAT_FLOAT_OUT</strong> can now accept a space-separated list of formats
as shorthand for first few columns.  On output it will show the formats
in effect for multiple columns.</li>
<li><strong>GMT_LANGUAGE</strong> has replaced the old parameter <strong>TIME_LANGUAGE</strong>.
Related to this, the files share/time/*.d have been moved and renamed to
share/localization/*.txt and now include a new section
or cardinal points letter codes.</li>
<li><strong>IO_SEGMENT_BINARY</strong> is a new parameter that controls how binary records
with just NaNs should or should not be interpreted as segment headers.</li>
<li><strong>PROJ_GEODESIC</strong> was added to control which geodesic calculation should be
used.  Choose among Vincenty [Default], Andoyer (fast approximate geodesics),
and Rudoe (from GMT4).</li>
<li><strong>TIME_REPORT</strong> now has defaults for absolute or elapsed time stamps.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="updated-common-options">
<h3>Updated common options<a class="headerlink" href="#updated-common-options" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Two of the established GMT common options have seen minor improvements:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Implemented modifier <strong>-B+n</strong> to <em>not</em> draw the frame at all.</li>
<li>Allow oblique Mercator projections to select projection poles in the
southern hemisphere by using upper-case selectors <strong>A</strong>|<strong>B</strong>|<strong>C</strong>.</li>
<li>Added a forth way to specify the region for a new grid via the new
<strong>-R</strong>[<strong>L</strong>|<strong>C</strong>|<strong>R</strong>][<strong>T</strong>|<strong>M</strong>|<strong>B</strong>]<em>x0</em>/<em>y0</em>/<em>nx</em>/<em>ny</em>
syntax where you specify an reference point and number of points in the two
dimensions (requires <strong>-I</strong> to use the increments).  The optional justification
keys specify how the reference point relate to the grid region.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id4">
<h3>General improvements<a class="headerlink" href="#id4" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Several changes have affects across GMT; these are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Added optional multi-threading capabilities to several modules, such as
<a class="reference internal" href="greenspline.html"><span class="doc">greenspline</span></a>, <a class="reference internal" href="grdfilter.html"><span class="doc">grdfilter</span></a>, <a class="reference internal" href="grdmask.html"><span class="doc">grdmask</span></a>, <a class="reference internal" href="grdsample.html"><span class="doc">grdsample</span></a>,
the potential supplement’s <a class="reference internal" href="supplements/potential/grdgravmag3d.html"><span class="doc">grdgravmag3d</span></a>,
<a class="reference internal" href="supplements/potential/talwani2d.html"><span class="doc">talwani2d</span></a> and
<a class="reference internal" href="supplements/potential/talwani2d.html"><span class="doc">talwani3d</span></a> and x2sys’s <a class="reference internal" href="supplements/x2sys/x2sys_solve.html"><span class="doc">x2sys_solve</span></a>.</li>
<li>Optional prerequisite LAPACK means SVD decomposition in <a class="reference internal" href="greenspline.html"><span class="doc">greenspline</span></a> is
now very fast, as is true for the regular Gauss-Jordan solution via a
new multi-processor enabled algorithm.</li>
<li>Allow comma-separated colors instead of CPTs in options that are
used to pass a CPT (typically this means the <strong>-C</strong> option).</li>
<li>Faster netCDF reading for COARDS table data (i.e., not grids).</li>
<li>When importing grids via GDAL the projection info is preserved and stored as netCDF metadata.
This will allow third party programs like GDAL and QGIS to recognize the projection info of
GMT created grids. Same thing happens when creating grids with <a class="reference internal" href="grdproject.html"><span class="doc">grdproject</span></a>.</li>
<li>Tools using GSHHG can now access information for both Antarctica data
sets (ice-front and grounding line).</li>
<li>Tools that specify pens may now explicitly choose “solid” as an attribute,
and we added “dashed” and “dotted” as alternatives to the shorthands “-” and “.”.</li>
<li>Added three alternative vector head choices (terminal, square and circle) in addition
to the default “arrow” style. We have also added the option for trimming the
beginning and/or end point location of a vector, and you may now place the
vector head at the mid-point of the vector instead at the ends.</li>
<li>All eight map embellishment features (map scale, color bar, direction rose, magnetic
rose, GMT logo, raster images, map insets, and map legends) now use a uniform
mechanism for specifying placement, justification, and attributes and is supported
by a new section in the documentation.</li>
<li>Typesetting simultaneous sub- and super-scripts has improved (i.e., when a symbol
should have both a subscript and and a superscript).</li>
<li>The custom symbol macro codes now allow for an unspecified symbol code (<strong>?</strong>), which
means the desired code will be given as last item on each data record.  Such custom
symbols must be specified with uppercase <strong>-SK</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="program-specific-improvements">
<h3>Program-specific improvements<a class="headerlink" href="#program-specific-improvements" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Finally, here is a list of enhancements to individual modules.  Any
changes to existing syntax will be backwards compatible:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference internal" href="fitcircle.html"><span class="doc">fitcircle</span></a> now has a new option <strong>-F</strong> that allows output to be in the
form of coordinates only (no text report) and you may choose which items to
return by appending suitable flags.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="gmt.html"><span class="doc">gmt</span></a> now has a --show-cores option that reports the available cores.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="gmtconvert.html"><span class="doc">convert</span></a> adds a <strong>-C</strong> option that can be used to eliminate
segments on output based on the number of records it contains.  We also
added a <strong>-F</strong> option to create line segments from an input data sets using
a variety of connectivity modes.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="gmtmath.html"><span class="doc">math</span></a> adds a long list of new operators.  We have the operator <strong>BPDF</strong> for binomial probability distribution and
<strong>BCDF</strong> for the cumulative binomial distribution function.  Due to confusion with
other probability distributions we have introduced a series of new operator names
(but honor backwards compatibility).  Listing the pdf and cdf for each distribution,
these are <strong>TPDF</strong> and <strong>TCDF</strong> for the Student t-distribution,
<strong>FPDF</strong> and <strong>FCDF</strong> for the F-distribution,
<strong>CHI2PDF</strong> and <strong>CHI2CDF</strong> for the Chi-squared distribution,
<strong>EPDF</strong> and <strong>ECDF</strong> for the exponential distribution (as well as <strong>ECRIT</strong>),
<strong>PPDF</strong> and <strong>PCDF</strong> for the Poisson distribution,
<strong>LPDF</strong> and <strong>LCDF</strong> for the Laplace distribution (as well as <strong>LCRIT</strong>),
<strong>RPDF</strong> and <strong>RCDF</strong> for the Rayleigh distribution (as well as <strong>RCRIT</strong>),
<strong>WPDF</strong> and <strong>WCDF</strong> for the Weibull distribution (as well as <strong>WCRIT</strong>), and
<strong>ZPDF</strong> and <strong>ZCDF</strong> for the Normal distribution. We added <strong>ROLL</strong> for cyclic shifts of the stack,
and <strong>DENAN</strong> as a more intuitive operator for removing NaNs, as
well as new constants <strong>TRANGE</strong>, <strong>TROW</strong>, <strong>F_EPS</strong> and <strong>D_EPS</strong>, and we have renamed the
normalized coordinates from <strong>Tn</strong> to <strong>TNORM</strong> (but this is backwards compatible).  We added
operator <strong>POINT</strong> which reads a data table and places the mean x and mean y on the stack.
Finally, we added new hyperbolic and inverse hyperbolic functions <strong>COTH</strong> and <strong>ACOTH</strong>,
<strong>SECH</strong> and <strong>ASECH</strong>, and <strong>CSCH</strong> and <strong>ACSCH</strong>.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="gmtspatial.html"><span class="doc">spatial</span></a> now lets you specify Flat Earth or Geodesic distance calculations
for line lengths via <strong>-Q</strong>.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="grdblend.html"><span class="doc">grdblend</span></a> relaxes the <strong>-W</strong> restriction on only one output grid
and adds the new mode <strong>-Wz</strong> to write the weight*zsum grid.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="grdedit.html"><span class="doc">grdedit</span></a> enhances the <strong>-E</strong> option to allow for 90-degree rotations
or flips of grid, as well as a new <strong>-G</strong> to enable writing of the result
to a new output file [Default updates the existing file]. The <strong>-J</strong> option
saves the georeferencing info as metadata in netCDF grids.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="grdfilter.html"><span class="doc">grdfilter</span></a> now includes histogram mode filtering to complement mode
(LMS) filtering.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="grdgradient.html"><span class="doc">grdgradient</span></a> adds <strong>-Da</strong> to compute the aspect (down-slope) direction [up-slope].</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="grdinfo.html"><span class="doc">grdinfo</span></a> reports the projection info of netCDF grids when that is stored in
a grid’s metadata in WKT format.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="grdmath.html"><span class="doc">grdmath</span></a> adds numerous new operators, such as <strong>ARC</strong> and <strong>WRAP</strong> for
angular operators, <strong>BPDF</strong> for binomial probability distribution and
<strong>BCDF</strong> for the cumulative binomial distribution function.  Due to confusion with
other probability distributions we have introduced a series of new operator names
(but accept backwards compatibility).  Listing the pdf and cdf for each distribution,
these are <strong>TPDF</strong> and <strong>TCDF</strong> for the Student t-distribution,
<strong>FPDF</strong> and <strong>FCDF</strong> for the F-distribution,
<strong>CHI2PDF</strong> and <strong>CHI2CDF</strong> for the Chi-squared distribution,
<strong>EPDF</strong> and <strong>ECDF</strong> for the exponential distribution (as well as <strong>ECRIT</strong>),
<strong>PPDF</strong> and <strong>PCDF</strong> for the Poisson distribution,
<strong>LPDF</strong> and <strong>LCDF</strong> for the Laplace distribution (as well as <strong>LCRIT</strong>),
<strong>RPDF</strong> and <strong>RCDF</strong> for the Rayleigh distribution (as well as <strong>RCRIT</strong>),
<strong>WPDF</strong> and <strong>WCDF</strong> for the Weibull distribution (as well as <strong>WCRIT</strong>), and
<strong>ZPDF</strong> and <strong>ZCDF</strong> for the Normal distribution.  We added <strong>LDISTG</strong> (for distances
to GSHHG), <strong>CDIST2</strong> and <strong>SDIST2</strong>
(to complement <strong>LDIST2</strong> and <strong>PDIST2</strong>), and <strong>ROLL</strong> for cyclic shifts of the stack,
and <strong>DENAN</strong> as a more intuitive operator for removing NaNs,
while <strong>LDIST1</strong> has been renamed
to <strong>LDISTC</strong>.  We also add new constants <strong>XRANGE</strong>, <strong>YRANGE</strong>, <strong>XCOL</strong>,
<strong>YROW</strong> and <strong>F_EPS</strong>, and we have renamed the normalized coordinates from <strong>Xn</strong> to <strong>XNORM</strong>
and <strong>Yn</strong> to <strong>YNORM</strong> (but this is backwards compatible).
Finally, we added new hyperbolic and inverse hyperbolic functions <strong>COTH</strong> and <strong>ACOTH</strong>,
<strong>SECH</strong> and <strong>ASECH</strong>, and <strong>CSCH</strong> and <strong>ACSCH</strong>.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="grdtrack.html"><span class="doc">grdtrack</span></a> add the modifier <strong>-G+l</strong><em>list</em> to pass a list of grids.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="grdview.html"><span class="doc">grdview</span></a> implements the Waterfall plot mode via <strong>-Qmx</strong>|<strong>y</strong>.</li>

<li><a class="reference internal" href="makecpt.html"><span class="doc">makecpt</span></a> takes <strong>-E</strong> to determine range from an input data table.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="mapproject.html"><span class="doc">mapproject</span></a> can be used in conjunction with the 3-D projection options to
compute 3-D projected coordinates.  We also added <strong>-W</strong> to simply output the
projected dimensions of the plot without reading input data.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="basemap.html"><span class="doc">basemap</span></a> now takes <strong>-A</strong> to save the plot domain polygon in geographical coordinates.
The <strong>-L</strong> option for map scale and <strong>-T</strong> for map roses have been revised (backwards compatible) and a
new uniform <strong>-F</strong> option to specify background panel and its many settings was added.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="coast.html"><span class="doc">coast</span></a> can accept multiple <strong>-E</strong> settings to color several features independently.
We also have the modifiers <strong>+AS</strong> to <em>only</em> plot Antarctica, <strong>+ag</strong> to use
shelf ice grounding line for Antarctica coastline, and <strong>+ai</strong> to use ice/water
front for Antarctica coastline [Default].  As above, the <strong>-L</strong> option for map scale
and <strong>-T</strong> option for map roses have been revised (backwards compatible) and a new uniform <strong>-F</strong> option to specify
background panel and its many settings was added.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="psconvert.html"><span class="doc">psconvert</span></a> (apart from the name change) has several new features, such as
reporting dimensions of the plot when <strong>-A</strong> and <strong>-V</strong> are used,
scaling the output plots via <strong>-A+s</strong>[<strong>m</strong>]<em>width</em>[<strong>u</strong>][/<em>height</em>[<strong>u</strong>]],
paint and outline the bounding box via <strong>-A</strong> modifiers <strong>g</strong><em>fill</em> and <strong>+p</strong><em>pen</em>,
and <strong>-Z</strong> for removing the PostScript file on exit.  In addition, we have
added SVG as a new output vector graphics format and now handle transparency even if
non-PDF output formats are requested.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="contour.html"><span class="doc">contour</span></a> adds a <strong>-Q</strong><em>cut</em> option like <a class="reference internal" href="grdcontour.html"><span class="doc">grdcontour</span></a> and consolidates the
old <strong>-T</strong>, <strong>-Q</strong> options for an index file to a new <strong>-E</strong> option.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="histogram.html"><span class="doc">histogram</span></a> added modifiers <strong>-W</strong><em>width</em>[<strong>+l</strong>|<strong>h</strong>|<strong>b</strong>]
to allow for more control on what happens to points falling in the tails.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="image.html"><span class="doc">image</span></a> added a new uniform <strong>-D</strong> option to specify location of the image and new uniform
<strong>-F</strong> option to specify background panel and its many settings.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="legend.html"><span class="doc">legend</span></a> has many enhancements for specifying varying cell widths and color, as

<strong>-F</strong> option to specify background panel and its many settings.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="colorbar.html"><span class="doc">colorbar</span></a> new uniform <strong>-D</strong> option to specify location of the scale. We have
retired the <strong>-T</strong> option in favor of the new uniform
<strong>-F</strong> option to specify background panel and its many settings.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="plot.html"><span class="doc">plot</span></a> has seen considerable enhancements. We added two new quoted
line (<strong>-Sq</strong>) modifiers: <strong>S</strong>|<strong>s</strong> for treating input as consecutive
two-point line segments that should be individually quoted,
and <strong>+x</strong>[<em>first</em>,<em>last</em>] for automating cross-section labeling.
We added a new symbol (<strong>-S~</strong>) for <em>decorated lines</em>.  These are very similar
to quoted lines but instead place specified symbols along lines.
We expanded <strong>-N</strong> to handle periodic, repeating symbols near the boundary,
added a new modifier <strong>+</strong> to <strong>-E</strong> for asymmetrical error bars, and provided the
shorthand <strong>-SE-</strong><em>diameter</em> for degenerated ellipses (i.e., circles).
The <strong>-L</strong> option has been enhanced to create envelope polygons around y(x),
say for confidence envelopes (modifiers <strong>+b</strong>|<strong>d</strong>|<strong>D</strong>), and to complete a closed
polygon by adding selected corners (modifiers <strong>+xl</strong>|<strong>r</strong>|<em>x0</em> or <strong>+yb</strong>|<strong>t</strong>|<em>y0</em>).
The <strong>-A</strong>-option now has new modifiers <strong>x</strong>|<strong>y</strong> for creating stair-case curves.
The slip-vector symbol can now optionally accept a vector-head angle [30].
The custom symbols definition tests can now compare two input variables.
We also added a <strong>-F</strong> option to draw line segments from an input data sets using
a variety of connectivity modes.  Finally, for drawing lines there are new line
attribute modifiers available via the pen setting <strong>-W</strong> such as drawing with a
Bezier spline (<strong>+s</strong>), trimming the segments from the ends before plotting (<strong>+o</strong><em>offset</em>),
or adding vector heads at the ends of the lines (<strong>+v</strong>).</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="plot3d.html"><span class="doc">plot3d</span></a> also has the new <strong>-SE-</strong><em>diameter</em> shorthand as well as the <strong>-N</strong>
modifiers for handling periodic plot symbols.  Like, plot it gets the same improvements
to quoted lines and adds decorated lines as a new symbol.  Likewise,
the <strong>-L</strong> option has been enhanced to create envelope polygons around y(x),
say for confidence envelopes (modifiers <strong>+b</strong>|<strong>d</strong>|<strong>D</strong>), and to complete a closed
polygon by adding selected corners (modifiers <strong>+xl</strong>|<strong>r</strong>|<em>x0</em> or <strong>+yb</strong>|<strong>t</strong>|<em>y0</em>).
The slip-vector symbol can now optionally accept a vector-head angle [30].
Finally, to match <a class="reference internal" href="plot.html"><span class="doc">plot</span></a> we have added the option <strong>-T</strong> for specifying no data input.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="sample1d.html"><span class="doc">sample1d</span></a> spline selection option <strong>-F</strong> can now accept the optional
modifiers <strong>+1</strong> or <strong>+2</strong> which will compute
the first or second derivatives of the spline, respectively.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="spectrum1d.html"><span class="doc">spectrum1d</span></a> can now turn off single-output data to stdout via <strong>-T</strong>
or turn off multi-file output via <strong>-N</strong>.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="sphdistance.html"><span class="doc">sphdistance</span></a> can now also perform a nearest-neighbor gridding where
all grid nodes inside a Voronoi polygon is set to the same value as the
Voronoi node value, via <strong>-Ez</strong>.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="trend1d.html"><span class="doc">trend1d</span></a> can now fit mixed polynomial and Fourier series models,
as well as allowing models with just some terms in a polynomial or a
Fourier series, including plain cosine or sine series terms.  Modifiers
have been added to specify data origin and fundamental period instead of
defaulting to the data mid-point and data range, respectively.</li>
</ul>
<p>A few supplement modules have new features as well:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference internal" href="supplements/mgd77/mgd77track.html"><span class="doc">mgd77track</span></a> adds the <strong>-Gn</strong><em>gap</em> option to
decimate the trackline coordinates by only plotting every <em>gap</em> point.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="supplements/potential/gravfft.html"><span class="doc">gravfft</span></a> adds <strong>-W</strong><em>wd</em> to change
observation level.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="supplements/potential/grdgravmag3d.html"><span class="doc">grdgravmag3d</span></a> adds <strong>-H</strong> to compute magnetic anomaly.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="supplements/spotter/grdpmodeler.html"><span class="doc">grdpmodeler</span></a> can now output more than one model
prediction into several grids or as a record written to stdout.  Also gains the <strong>-N</strong> option
used by other spotter tools to extend the model duration.</li>

<h2>New Features in GMT 5<a class="headerlink" href="#new-features-in-gmt-5" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>GMT 5 represents a new branch of GMT development that mostly preserves the
capabilities of the previous versions while adding over 200 new features
to an already extensive bag of tricks.  Our PostScript library
<a class="reference internal" href="postscriptlight.html"><span class="doc">PSL</span></a> has seen a complete rewrite as well
and produce shorter and more compact PostScript. However, the big news
is aimed for developers who wish to leverage GMT in their own applications.
We have completely revamped the code base so that high-level
GMT functionality is now accessible via GMT “modules”. These are
high-level functions named after their corresponding programs (e.g.,
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">GMT_grdimage</span></code>) that contains all of the functionality of that program
within the function. While currently callable from C/C++ only (with some
support for F77), we are making progress on the Matlab interface as well
and there are plans to start on the Python version. Developers should
consult the <a class="reference internal" href="GMT_API.html"><span class="doc">GMT API</span></a> documentation for more details.</p>
<p>We recommend that users of GMT 4 consider learning the new rules and defaults
since eventually (in some years) GMT 4 will be obsolete.
To ease the transition to GMT 5 you may run it in compatibility mode,
thus allowing the use of many obsolete default names and command
switches (you will receive a warning instead).  This is discussed below.</p>
<p>Below are six key areas of improvements in GMT 5.</p>
<div class="section" id="new-programs">
<h3>New programs<a class="headerlink" href="#new-programs" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>First, a few new programs have been added and some have been
promoted (and possibly renamed) from earlier supplements:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt><a class="reference internal" href="gmt.html"><span class="doc">gmt</span></a></dt>
<dd>This is the <strong>only</strong> program executable that is distributed with GMT 5. To avoid
problems with namespace conflicts (e.g., there are other, non-GMT programs
with generic names like triangulate, surface, etc.) all GMT 5 modules are
launched from the gmt executable via “gmt module” calls (e.g, gmt coast).
For backwards compatibility (see below) we also offer symbolic links with
the old executable names that simply point to the gmt program, which then
can start the correct module.  Any module whose name starts with “gmt” can
be abbreviated, e.g., “gmt gmtconvert” may be called as “gmt convert”.</dd>

</dl>
<p>We have also added a new supplement called potential that contains these five modules:</p>

</dl>

<h3>New common options<a class="headerlink" href="#id5" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>First we discuss changes that have been
implemented by a series of new lower-case GMT common options:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Programs that read data tables can now process the aspatial metadata
in OGR/GMT files with the new <strong>-a</strong> option. These can be produced by
<strong>ogr2ogr</strong> (a GDAL tool) when selecting the -f “GMT” output
format. See Chapter <a class="reference internal" href="GMT_Docs_classic.html#ogr-compat"><span class="std std-ref">The GMT Vector Data Format for OGR Compatibility</span></a> for an explanation of the OGR/GMT file format.
Because all GIS information is encoded via GMT comment lines these
files can also be used in GMT 4 (the GIS metadata is simply
skipped).</li>
<li>Programs that read or write data tables can specify a custom binary format
using the enhanced <strong>-b</strong> option.</li>
<li>Programs that read data tables can control which columns to read and
in what order (and optionally supply scaling relations) with the new <strong>-i</strong> option</li>
<li>Programs that read grids can use new common option <strong>-n</strong> to control
grid interpolation settings and boundary conditions.</li>
<li>Programs that write data tables can control which columns to write
and in what order (and optionally supply scaling relations) with the new <strong>-o</strong> option.</li>
<li>All plot programs can take a new <strong>-p</strong> option for perspective view
from infinity. In GMT 4, only some programs could do this (e.g.,
<a class="reference internal" href="coast.html"><span class="doc">coast</span></a>) and it took a
program-specific option, typically <strong>-E</strong> and sometimes an option
<strong>-Z</strong> would be needed as well. This information is now all passed
via <strong>-p</strong> and applies across all GMT plotting programs.</li>
<li>Programs that read data tables can control how records with NaNs are
handled with the new <strong>-s</strong> option.</li>
<li>All plot programs can take a new <strong>-t</strong> option to modify the PDF
transparency level for that layer. However, as PostScript has no provision for
transparency you can only see the effect if you convert it to PDF.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id6">
<h3>Updated common options<a class="headerlink" href="#id6" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Some of the established GMT common options have seen significant
improvements; these include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The completely revised <strong>-B</strong> option can now handle irregular and custom annotations
(see Section <a class="reference internal" href="GMT_Docs_classic.html#custom-axes"><span class="std std-ref">Custom axes</span></a>). It also has a new automatic mode which
will select optimal intervals given data range and plot size. The 3-D base maps can now have
horizontal gridlines on xz and yz back walls.</li>
<li>The <strong>-R</strong> option may now accept a leading unit which implies the
given coordinates are projected map coordinates and should be
replaced with the corresponding geographic coordinates given the
specified map projection. For linear projections such units imply a
simple unit conversion for the given coordinates (e.g., km to meter).</li>
<li>Introduced <strong>-fp</strong>[<em>unit</em>] which allows data input to be in
projected values, e.g., UTM coordinates while <strong>-Ju</strong> is given.</li>
</ul>
<p>While just giving - (the hyphen) as argument presents just the synopsis of the command
line arguments, we now also support giving + which in addition will list
the explanations for all options that are not among the GMT common set.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id7">
<h3>New default parameters<a class="headerlink" href="#id7" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Most of the GMT default parameters have changed names in order to
group parameters into logical groups and to use more consistent naming.
However, under compatibility mode (see below) the old names are still recognized.
New capabilities have been implemented by introducing new GMT default settings:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference internal" href="gmt.conf.html#dir-parameters"><span class="std std-ref">DIR_DCW</span></a> specifies where to look for the optional
Digital Charts of the World database (for country coloring or selections).</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="gmt.conf.html#dir-parameters"><span class="std std-ref">DIR_GSHHG</span></a> specifies where to look for the required
Global Self-consistent Hierarchical High-resolution Geography database.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="gmt.conf.html#gmt-compatibility"><span class="std std-ref">GMT_COMPATIBILITY</span></a> can be set to 4 to allow
backwards compatibility with GMT 4 command-line syntax or 5 to impose
strict GMT5 syntax checking.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="gmt.conf.html#io-nc4-chunk-size"><span class="std std-ref">IO_NC4_CHUNK_SIZE</span></a> is used to set the default
chunk size for the <strong>lat</strong> and <strong>lon</strong> dimension of the <strong>z</strong> variable of
netCDF version 4 files.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="gmt.conf.html#io-nc4-deflation-level"><span class="std std-ref">IO_NC4_DEFLATION_LEVEL</span></a> is used to set
the compression level for netCDF4 files upon output.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="gmt.conf.html#io-segment-marker"><span class="std std-ref">IO_SEGMENT_MARKER</span></a> can be used to change the
character that GMT uses to identify new segment header records [&gt;].</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="gmt.conf.html#map-annot-ortho"><span class="std std-ref">MAP_ANNOT_ORTHO</span></a> controls whether axes annotations
for Cartesian plots are horizontal or orthogonal to the individual axes.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="gmt.conf.html#gmt-fft"><span class="std std-ref">GMT_FFT</span></a> controls which algorithms to use for Fourier
transforms.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="gmt.conf.html#gmt-triangulate"><span class="std std-ref">GMT_TRIANGULATE</span></a> controls which algorithm to use
for Delaunay triangulation.</li>
<li>Great circle distance approximations can now be fine-tuned via new GMT default parameters
<a class="reference internal" href="gmt.conf.html#proj-mean-radius"><span class="std std-ref">PROJ_MEAN_RADIUS</span></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="gmt.conf.html#proj-aux-latitude"><span class="std std-ref">PROJ_AUX_LATITUDE</span></a>.
Geodesics are now even more accurate by using the Vincenty [1975] algorithm instead of
Rudoe’s method.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="gmt.conf.html#gmt-extrapolate-val"><span class="std std-ref">GMT_EXTRAPOLATE_VAL</span></a> controls what splines should do if
requested to extrapolate beyond the given data domain.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="gmt.conf.html#ps-transparency"><span class="std std-ref">PS_TRANSPARENCY</span></a> allows users to modify how transparency will be
processed when converted to PDF [Normal].</li>
</ul>
<p>A few parameters have been introduced in GMT 5 in the past and have been removed again.
Among these are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><em>DIR_USER</em>: was supposed to set the directory in which the user configuration files, or data are stored, but
this creates problems, because it needs to be known already before it is potentially set in <em>DIR_USER</em>/gmt.conf.
The environment variable <strong>$GMT_USERDIR</strong> is used for this instead.</li>
<li><em>DIR_TMP</em>: was supposed to indicate the directory in which to store temporary files. But needs to be known without
gmt.conf file as well. So the environment variable <strong>$GMT_TMPDIR</strong> is used instead.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id8">
<h3>General improvements<a class="headerlink" href="#id8" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Other wide-ranging changes have been implemented in different
ways, such as</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>All programs now use consistent, standardized choices for plot
dimension units (<strong>c</strong>m, <strong>i</strong>nch, or <strong>p</strong>oint; we no longer
consider <strong>m</strong>eter a plot length unit), and actual distances
(choose spherical arc lengths in <strong>d</strong>egree, <strong>m</strong>inute, and
<strong>s</strong>econd [was <strong>c</strong>], or distances in m<strong>e</strong>ter [Default],
<strong>f</strong>oot [new], <strong>k</strong>m, <strong>M</strong>ile [was sometimes <strong>i</strong> or
<strong>m</strong>], <strong>n</strong>autical mile, and s<strong>u</strong>rvey foot [new]).</li>
<li>Programs that read data tables can now process multi-segment tables
automatically. This means programs that did not have this capability
(e.g., <a class="reference internal" href="filter1d.html"><span class="doc">filter1d</span></a>) can now all operate on the
segments separately; consequently, there is no longer a <strong>-m</strong>
option.</li>
<li>While we support the scaling of z-values in grids via the filename convention
name[=<em>ID</em>[<strong>+s</strong><em>scale</em>][<strong>+o</strong><em>offset</em>][<strong>+n</strong><em>nan</em>] mechanism, there are times
when we wish to scale the x,y domain as well. Users can now
append <strong>+u</strong><em>unit</em> to their gridfile names, where <em>unit</em> is one of non-arc units listed
in Table <a class="reference internal" href="GMT_Docs_classic.html#tbl-distunits"><span class="std std-ref">distunits</span></a>.  This will convert your Cartesian
x and y coordinates <em>from</em> the given unit <em>to</em> meters.  We also support the inverse
option <strong>+U</strong><em>unit</em>, which can be used to convert your grid
coordinates <em>from</em> meters <em>to</em> the specified unit.</li>
<li>CPTs also support the <strong>+u</strong>|<strong>U</strong><em>unit</em> mechanism.  Here, the scaling
applies to the z values.  By appending these modifiers to your CPT names you
can avoid having two CPTs (one for meter and one for km) since only one is needed.</li>
<li>Programs that read grids can now directly handle Arc/Info float binary
files (GRIDFLOAT) and ESRI .hdr formats.</li>
<li>Programs that read grids now set boundary conditions to aid further
processing. If a subset then the boundary conditions are taken from
the surrounding grid values.</li>
<li>All text can now optionally be filled with patterns and/or drawn with
outline pens. In the past, only <a class="reference internal" href="text.html"><span class="doc">text</span></a> could plot outline fonts via
<strong>-S</strong><em>pen</em>. Now, any text can be an outline text by manipulating
the corresponding FONT defaults (e.g., <a class="reference internal" href="gmt.conf.html#font-title"><span class="std std-ref">FONT_TITLE</span></a>).</li>
<li>All color or fill specifications may append &#64;<em>transparency</em> to
change the PDF transparency level for that item. See <strong>-t</strong> for
limitations on how to visualize this transparency.</li>
<li>GMT now ships with 36 standard color palette tables (CPT), up from 24.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id9">
<h3>Program-specific improvements<a class="headerlink" href="#id9" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Finally, here is a list of numerous enhancements to individual programs:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference internal" href="blockmean.html"><span class="doc">blockmean</span></a> added <strong>-Ep</strong> for error propagation and
<strong>-Sn</strong> to report the number of data points per block.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="blockmedian.html"><span class="doc">blockmedian</span></a> added <strong>-Er</strong>[-]
to return as last column the record number that gave the median
value. For ties, we return the record number of the higher data value
unless <strong>-Er</strong>- is given (return lower). Added <strong>-Es</strong> to read and
output source id for median value.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="blockmode.html"><span class="doc">blockmode</span></a> added <strong>-Er</strong>[-] but
for modal value. Added <strong>-Es</strong> to read and output source id for modal
value.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="gmtconvert.html"><span class="doc">convert</span></a> now has optional PCRE (regular expression) support,
as well as a new option to select a subset of segments specified by
segment running numbers (<strong>-Q</strong>) and improved options to extract a
subset of records (<strong>-E</strong>) and support for a list of search strings
via <strong>-S+f</strong><em>patternfile</em>.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="gmtinfo.html"><span class="doc">info</span></a> has new option <strong>-A</strong> to
select what group to report on (all input, per file, or per segment).
Also, use <strong>-If</strong> to report an extended region optimized for fastest results in FFTs.
and <strong>-Is</strong> to report an extended region optimized for fastest results in <a class="reference internal" href="surface.html"><span class="doc">surface</span></a>.
Finally, new option <strong>-D</strong>[<em>inc</em>] to align regions found via <strong>-I</strong> with the center
of the data.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="gmtmath.html"><span class="doc">math</span></a> with <strong>-N</strong><em>ncol</em> and input
files will add extra blank columns, if needed.  A new option <strong>-E</strong>
sets the minimum eigenvalue used by operators LSQFIT and SVDFIT.
Option <strong>-L</strong> applies operators on a per-segment basis instead of
accumulating operations across the entire file.  Many new
operators have been added (BITAND, BITLEFT, BITNOT, BITOR, BITRIGHT,
BITTEST, BITXOR, DIFF, IFELSE, ISFINITE, SVDFIT, TAPER).  Finally,
we have implemented user macros for long or commonly used expressions,
as well as ability to store and recall using named variables.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="gmtselect.html"><span class="doc">select</span></a> Takes <strong>-E</strong> to indicate if points exactly on a polygon
boundary are inside or outside, and <strong>-Z</strong> can now be extended to apply
to other columns than the third.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="grd2cpt.html"><span class="doc">grd2cpt</span></a> takes <strong>-F</strong> to specify output color model and <strong>-G</strong> to
truncate incoming CPT to be limited to a given range.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="grd2xyz.html"><span class="doc">grd2xyz</span></a> takes <strong>-C</strong> to write row, col instead of x,y.  Append <strong>f</strong>
to start at 1, else start at 0.  Alternatively, use <strong>-Ci</strong> to write just
the two columns <em>index</em> and <em>z</em>, where <em>index</em>
is the 1-D indexing that GMT uses when referring to grid nodes.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="grdblend.html"><span class="doc">grdblend</span></a> can now take list of grids on
the command line and blend, and now has more blend choices (see <strong>-C</strong>). Grids no
longer have to have same registration or spacing.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="grdclip.html"><span class="doc">grdclip</span></a> has new option <strong>-Si</strong> to set all data &gt;= low and &lt;= high
to the <em>between</em> value, and <strong>-Sr</strong> to set all data == old to the <em>new</em> value.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="grdcontour.html"><span class="doc">grdcontour</span></a> can specify a single contour with <strong>-C+</strong><em>contour</em> and
<strong>-A+</strong><em>contour</em>.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="grdcut.html"><span class="doc">grdcut</span></a> can use <strong>-S</strong> to specify an origin and radius and cut the
corresponding rectangular area, and <strong>-N</strong> to extend the region if the new
<strong>-R</strong> domain exceeds existing boundaries.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="grdfft.html"><span class="doc">grdfft</span></a> can now accept two grids and let <strong>-E</strong> compute the cross-spectra.
The <strong>-N</strong> option allows for many new and special settings, including ability
to control data mirroring, detrending, tapering, and output of intermediate
results.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="grdfilter.html"><span class="doc">grdfilter</span></a> can now do spherical
filtering (with wrap around longitudes and over poles) for non-global
grids. We have also begun implementing Open MP threads to speed up
calculations on multi-core machines. We have added rectangular
filtering and automatic resampling to input resolution for high-pass
filters. There is also <strong>-Ff</strong><em>weightgrd</em> which reads the gridfile
<em>weightgrd</em> for a custom Cartesian grid convolution. The <em>weightgrd</em>
must have odd dimensions. Similarly added <strong>-Fo</strong><em>opgrd</em> for
operators (via coefficients in the grdfile <em>opgrd</em>) whose weight sum
is zero (hence we do not sum and divide the convolution by the weight
sum).</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="grdgradient.html"><span class="doc">grdgradient</span></a> now has <strong>-Em</strong> that gives results close to ESRI’s
“hillshade”’” (but faster).</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="grdinfo.html"><span class="doc">grdinfo</span></a> now has modifier
<strong>-Ts</strong><em>dz</em> which returns a symmetrical range about zero.  Also,
if <strong>-Ib</strong> is given then the grid’s bounding box polygon is written.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="grdimage.html"><span class="doc">grdimage</span></a> with GDAL support can write a raster image directly to
a raster file (<strong>-A</strong>) and may plot raster images as well (<strong>-Dr</strong>).
It also automatically assigns a color table if none is given and can use
any of the 36 GMT color tables and scale them to fit the grid range.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="grdmask.html"><span class="doc">grdmask</span></a> has new option
<strong>-Ni</strong>|I|p|P to set inside of
polygons to the polygon IDs. These may come from OGR aspatial values,
segment head <strong>-L</strong>ID, or a running number, starting at a specified
origin [0]. Now correctly handles polygons with perimeters and holes.
Added z as possible radius value in <strong>-S</strong> which means read radii
from 3rd input column.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="grdmath.html"><span class="doc">grdmath</span></a> added many new operators such as BITAND, BITLEFT, BITNOT, BITOR, BITRIGHT,
BITTEST, BITXOR, DEG2KM, IFELSE, ISFINITE, KM2DEG, and TAPER.  Finally,
we have implemented user macros for long or commonly used expressions,
as well as ability to store and recall using named variables.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="grdtrack.html"><span class="doc">grdtrack</span></a> has many new options.  The <strong>-A</strong> option controls how the
input track is resampled when <strong>-C</strong> is selected, the new <strong>-C</strong>, <strong>-D</strong>
options automatically create an equidistant set of cross-sectional
profiles given input line segments; one or more grids can then be
sampled at these locations.  The <strong>-E</strong> option allows users to quickly specify
tracks for sampling without needed input tracks.  Also added <strong>-S</strong> which stack
cross-profiles generated with <strong>-C</strong>. The <strong>-N</strong> will not skip
points that are outside the grid domain but return NaN as sampled
value.  Finally, <strong>-T</strong> will return the nearest non-NaN node if the initial
location only finds a NaN value.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="grdvector.html"><span class="doc">grdvector</span></a> can now take <strong>-Si</strong><em>scale</em> to give the reciprocal scale,
i.e., cm/ unit or km/unit.  Also, the vector heads in GMT have completely been overhauled
and includes geo-vector heads that follow great or small circles.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="grdview.html"><span class="doc">grdview</span></a> will automatically assigns a color table if none is given and can use
any of the 36 GMT color tables and scale them to fit the grid range.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="grdvolume.html"><span class="doc">grdvolume</span></a> can let <strong>-S</strong> accept more distance units than just km. It also
has a modified <strong>-T</strong>[<strong>c</strong>|<strong>h</strong>] for ORS estimates based on max
curvature or height. <strong>-Cr</strong> to compute the <em>outside</em> volume between two contours
(for instances, the volume of water from a bathymetry grid).</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="greenspline.html"><span class="doc">greenspline</span></a> has an improved <strong>-C</strong> option to control how many eigenvalues are used
in the fitting, and <strong>-Sl</strong> adds a linear (or bilinear) spline.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="makecpt.html"><span class="doc">makecpt</span></a> has a new <strong>-F</strong> option to
specify output color representation, e.g., to output the CPT in
h-s-v format despite originally being given in r/g/b, and <strong>-G</strong> to
truncate incoming CPT to be limited to a given range.  It also adds <strong>Di</strong>
to match the bottom/top values in the input CPT.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="mapproject.html"><span class="doc">mapproject</span></a> has a new <strong>-N</strong>
option to do geodetic/geocentric conversions; it combines with <strong>-I</strong>
for inverse conversions. Also, we have extended <strong>-A</strong> to accept
<strong>-A</strong><strong>o</strong>| <strong>O</strong> to compute line orientations (-90/90).
In <strong>-G</strong>, prepend - to the unit for (fast) flat Earth or + for (slow) geodesic calculations.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="project.html"><span class="doc">project</span></a> has added <strong>-G</strong>…[+] so
if + is appended we get a segment header with information about the
pole for the circle. Optionally, append /<em>colat</em> in <strong>-G</strong> for a small circle path.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="psconvert.html"><span class="doc">psconvert</span></a> has added a <strong>-TF</strong> option to create multi-page PDF files. There is
also modification to <strong>-A</strong> to add user-specified margins, and it automatically detects
if transparent elements have been included (and a detour via PDF might be needed).</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="basemap.html"><span class="doc">basemap</span></a> has added a <strong>-D</strong> option to place a map-inset box.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="clip.html"><span class="doc">clip</span></a> has added an extended <strong>-C</strong> option to close different types of clip paths.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="coast.html"><span class="doc">coast</span></a> has added a new option <strong>-E</strong> which lets users specify one or more countries
to paint, fill, extract, or use as plot domain (requires DCW to be installed).</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="contour.html"><span class="doc">contour</span></a> is now similar to <a class="reference internal" href="grdcontour.html"><span class="doc">grdcontour</span></a> in the options it
takes, e.g., <strong>-C</strong> in particular. In GMT 4, the program could only
read a CPT and not take a specific contour interval.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="histogram.html"><span class="doc">histogram</span></a> now takes <strong>-D</strong> to place histogram count labels on top of each bar
and <strong>-N</strong> to draw the equivalent normal distributions.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="legend.html"><span class="doc">legend</span></a> no longer uses system calls to do the plotting.  The modified <strong>-D</strong>
allows for minor offsets, while <strong>-F</strong> offers more control over the frame and fill.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="rose.html"><span class="doc">rose</span></a> has added <strong>-Wv</strong><em>pen</em> to
specify pen for vector (specified in <strong>-C</strong>). Added <strong>-Zu</strong> to set all radii to
unity (i.e., for analysis of angles only).</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="colorbar.html"><span class="doc">colorbar</span></a> has a new option <strong>-T</strong> that paints a rectangle behind the color bar.
The <strong>+n</strong> modifier to <strong>-E</strong> draws a rectangle with NaN color and adds a label.
The <strong>-G</strong> option will truncate incoming CPT to be limited to the specified z-range.
Modification <strong>-Np</strong> indicates a preference to use polygons to draw the color bar.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="text.html"><span class="doc">text</span></a> can take simplified input
via new option <strong>-F</strong> to set fixed font (including size), angle, and
justification. If these parameters are fixed for all the text strings
then the input can simply be <em>x y text</em>.  It also has enhanced <strong>-DJ</strong> option
to shorten diagonal offsets by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sqrt{2}\)</span> to maintain the same
radial distance from point to annotation. Change all text to upper or
lower case with <strong>-Q</strong>.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="plot.html"><span class="doc">plot</span></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="plot3d.html"><span class="doc">plot3d</span></a> both support the revised custom symbol macro
language which has been expanded considerably to allow for complicated,
multi-parameter symbols; see Chapter <a class="reference internal" href="GMT_Docs_classic.html#app-custom-symbols"><span class="std std-ref">Custom Plot Symbols</span></a>
for details. Finally, we allow the base for bars and columns optionally to be
read from data file by not specifying the base value.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="sample1d.html"><span class="doc">sample1d</span></a> offers <strong>-A</strong> to control resampling of spatial curves (with <strong>-I</strong>).</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="spectrum1d.html"><span class="doc">spectrum1d</span></a> has added <strong>-L</strong> to control removal of trend, mean value or mid value.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="surface.html"><span class="doc">surface</span></a> has added <strong>-r</strong> to create pixel-registered grids and knows about
periodicity in longitude (given <strong>-fg</strong>).  There is also <strong>-D</strong> to supply a “sort” break line.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="triangulate.html"><span class="doc">triangulate</span></a> now offers <strong>-S</strong>
to write triangle polygons and can handle 2-column input if <strong>-Z</strong> is given.
Can also write triangle edges as line with <strong>-M</strong>.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="xyz2grd.html"><span class="doc">xyz2grd</span></a> now also offers <strong>-Af</strong> (first value encountered),
<strong>-Am</strong> (mean, the default), <strong>-Ar</strong> (rms), and <strong>-As</strong> (last value encountered).</li>
</ul>
<p>Several supplements have new features as well:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference internal" href="supplements/img/img2grd.html"><span class="doc">img2grd</span></a>
used to be a shell script but is now a C program and can be used on all platforms.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="supplements/mgd77/mgd77convert.html"><span class="doc">mgd77convert</span></a>
added <strong>-C</strong> option to assemble *.mgd77 files from *.h77/*.a77 pairs.</li>
<li>The spotter programs can now read GPlates rotation files directly as well
as write this format. Also,
<a class="reference internal" href="supplements/spotter/rotconverter.html"><span class="doc">rotconverter</span></a> can extract plate
circuit rotations on-the-fly from the GPlates rotation file.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: GMT 5 only produces PostScript and no longer has a setting for
Encapsulated PostScript (EPS). We made this decision since (a) our EPS determination
was always very approximate (no consideration of font metrics, etc.) and quite often wrong,
and (b) <a class="reference internal" href="psconvert.html"><span class="doc">psconvert</span></a> handles it exactly.  Hence, users who need EPS plots should
simply process their PostScript files via <a class="reference internal" href="psconvert.html"><span class="doc">psconvert</span></a>.</p>
